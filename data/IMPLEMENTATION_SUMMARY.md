**Date**: Week 1 - October 2025  
**Status**: Complete - All core modules implemented, tested, and documented

## What We Built

A simplified, research-driven data pipeline for cryptocurrency portfolio management using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

### Completed Modules (3/3)

#### ✅ `data_loader.py` (~145 lines)
**Purpose**: Load OHLCV data from PostgreSQL database

**Functions**:
- `load_ohlcv(coins, start_date, end_date)` → DataFrame
- `get_available_coins()` → List of coin IDs
- `load_index_constituents(period_date)` → List of coins in index

**Key Features**:
- Direct SQL queries with SQLAlchemy
- Parameterized queries for security
- Returns clean pandas DataFrames
- No preprocessing or transformations

#### ✅ `data_processor.py` (~195 lines)
**Purpose**: Transform DataFrames into normalized 3D tensors for RL

**Functions**:
- `create_tensor(df, features, window_size)` → (state, future_prices, coins)
- `validate_tensor(tensor, shape)` → bool

**Key Features**:
- Requires `window_size + 1` periods in input
- Returns state tensor `[features × coins × window_size]` for agent
- Returns future prices `[coins]` for reward calculation
- Normalizes by last close price (relative prices)
- Filters coins with incomplete data automatically

#### ✅ `config.py` (~90 lines)
**Purpose**: Configuration management

**Classes**:
- `DatabaseConfig()` - reads from environment variables
- `DataConfig(window_size, feature_number)` - defines feature sets

**Key Features**:
- Simple environment variable reading
- 5 feature set variants from Jiang et al. 2017
- Backfilling configuration (FFILL_THRESHOLD=2, MAX_GAP=7)
- Train/val/test split years (2018-2022/2023/2024-2025)
- Caching configuration (USE_CACHE=True, CACHE_DIR="./cache")

#### ✅ `data_transformer.py` (~623 lines)
**Purpose**: Orchestration, train/val/test splits, rolling windows, caching

**Functions**:
- `backfill_missing_data()` - Hybrid ffill/interpolation strategy
- `get_monthly_periods()` - Generate monthly period boundaries
- `load_monthly_dataset()` - Load month data with backfilling, select top 10 coins
- `create_rolling_windows()` - Generate daily rolling windows per month
- `save_processed_windows()` - Save tensors to NPZ format
- `load_processed_windows()` - Load cached tensors
- `create_train_val_test_split()` - Main orchestration with caching
- `get_dataset_statistics()` - Calculate dataset statistics

**Key Features**:
- Fixed 10 coins per month (Jiang's approach)
- Extended rolling windows (load window_size days before month)
- Hybrid backfilling: ffill ≤2 days, interpolate 3-7 days, drop >7 days
- NPZ caching for fast loading (~150-300 MB compressed)
- Year-based splits: Train (Jul 2018-2022), Val (2023), Test (2024-2025)
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Optimized for team sharing via cloud storage

## Design Decisions

### 1. Daily Data (Not Intraday)

**Decision**: Use daily OHLCV data with daily rebalancing  
**Rationale**: 
- Practical for retail investors
- Faster iteration (48x less data than 30-min bars)
- Less noisy than intraday data
- Aligns with monthly index rebalancing

**Comparison to Jiang et al.**:
- They used: 30-minute bars, rebalance every 30 min
- We use: Daily bars, rebalance daily
- Same framework, different time scale

### 2. Index Constituents (Not Volume Selection)

**Decision**: Use monthly index with top 10 coins by market cap  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents survivorship bias (coins enter/exit realistically)
- Prevents lookahead bias (selected using historical data only)
- Mimics real-world index funds
- More stable than volume-based selection

**Comparison to Jiang et al.**:
- They used: Fixed set of coins by volume over entire period
- We use: Dynamic monthly index rebalancing

### 3. Fixed 10 Coins Per Month

**Decision**: Always use exactly 10 coins per month (Jiang's approach)  
**Rationale**:
- Verified from Jiang's GitHub implementation
- Neural network requires fixed tensor dimensions
- Load 15 candidate coins, select top 10 by market cap
- Drop month if <10 coins meet data quality requirements

**Implementation**:
```python
# Load 15 candidates from index
candidates = load_index_constituents(period_date, limit=15)
# After backfilling, select best 10
selected_coins = top_10_by_market_cap(valid_candidates)
```

### 4. Extended Rolling Windows Strategy

**Decision**: Load window_size days before month start for rolling windows  
**Rationale**:
- Adapted Jiang's continuous rolling windows to monthly boundaries
- Ensures every day in month has full 50-day lookback
- More training samples (~2640 windows vs ~88 months)
- Maintains temporal ordering within months

**Example**:
```
Month: Jan 2019 (31 days)
Load data: Dec 12, 2018 - Jan 31, 2019 (50 + 31 = 81 days)
Windows: 31 windows, one per day in January
```

### 5. Hybrid Backfilling Strategy

**Decision**: Forward fill ≤2 days, interpolate 3-7 days, drop >7 days  
**Rationale**:
- Forward fill preserves actual prices for short gaps (weekends)
- Linear interpolation reasonable for medium gaps (3-7 days)
- Drop coins with large gaps (>7 days) - data too unreliable
- Prevents introducing artificial patterns into training data

**Implementation**:
- BACKFILL_FFILL_THRESHOLD = 2 days
- BACKFILL_MAX_GAP = 7 days
- Drop coins still with NaN after backfilling

### 6. Year-Based Train/Val/Test Split

**Decision**: Train (Jul 2018-2022), Val (2023), Test (2024-2025)  
**Rationale**:
- Maximize training data (reliable data starts Jul 2018)
- Full year validation (better for seasonal patterns)
- 2-year test period (robust evaluation)
- Temporal ordering prevents lookahead bias

**Comparison to Jiang et al.**:
- They used: 50% train, 25% validation, 25% test (by sample count)
- We use: Year-based boundaries (better for thesis/publication)

### 7. Normalization by Last Close

**Decision**: Divide all prices by last close in window  
**Rationale**:
- Scale-invariant (works for $0.01 and $10,000 coins)
- Focuses on returns, not absolute prices
- Numerical stability for neural networks
- Standard in Jiang et al. framework

**Result**: Last close price always equals 1.0

### 8. NPZ Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Cache processed tensors in compressed NPZ format  
**Rationale**:
- Fast loading: ~5-10 seconds vs. 10-30 minutes from database
- Team sharing: Upload to Google Drive, partner downloads
- Reproducibility: Same data splits across experiments
- Storage efficient: ~150-300 MB compressed for full dataset

**Implementation**:
```python
# First run: Load from database, save cache
windows = create_train_val_test_split(use_cache=False)
# Subsequent runs: Load from cache (~100x faster)
windows = create_train_val_test_split(use_cache=True)
```

### 9. Window Size + 1 Periods

**Decision**: Load `window_size + 1` periods, use last for reward  
**Rationale**:
- RL needs current state AND next state's reward
- Matches Jiang's implementation exactly
- Clean separation: state (first 50) vs. reward (period 51)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Load 51 days
state = tensor[:, :, :50]      # Days 1-50 for agent
future = prices[50]             # Day 51 for reward
```

### 10. Separation of Concerns

**Decision**: Three focused modules (loader, processor, transformer)  
**Rationale**:
- **data_loader**: Only database queries
- **data_processor**: Only DataFrame → tensor
- **data_transformer**: Only orchestration, splits, caching

**Benefits**:
- Each module is simple and testable
- Easy to understand and modify
- Can swap out implementations easily

## Key Insights from Research

### From Jiang et al. (2017)

1. **No Traditional Technical Indicators**
   - Framework uses raw OHLCV data only
   - CNN/RNN learns patterns automatically
   - No SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands needed

2. **Tensor Structure is Critical**
   - 3D shape: `[features, coins, time]`
   - Normalized relative prices
   - Fixed window size (50 periods)

3. **Data Preprocessing is Minimal**
   - Normalization by last close
   - That's it - no complex feature engineering

### From Our Implementation Experience

1. **Simplicity Wins**
   - Original plan was too complex
   - Stripped down to essentials
   - Much easier to debug and understand

2. **Daily Data is Sufficient**
   - Don't need 30-min bars to start
   - Can add higher frequency later if needed
   - Proves concept first

3. **Index Rebalancing is Better**
   - More realistic than fixed coin universe
   - Prevents biases
   - Matches real-world investment behavior

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- Starting simple and iterating
- Reading original papers carefully
- Separating concerns into focused modules
- Testing each component independently
- Extensive design discussion before implementation
- Consulting Jiang's GitHub for implementation details
- Iterating on train/val/test split strategy (3 refinements)
- Emphasis on "simplicity and effectiveness over complexity"

### What Didn't Work Initially
- Over-complicated DatabaseConfig with too many parameters
- Trying to handle too much in data_loader.py
- Not understanding window_size + 1 requirement initially
- Import paths (absolute vs relative imports)
- Pandas deprecation warnings (fillna with method parameter)

### Critical Design Discussions
We resolved 6 key architectural questions through research and iteration:
1. **Monthly transitions**: Strict monthly datasets (no cross-month windows)
2. **Rolling windows**: Extended windows (load window_size days before month)
3. **Coin counts**: Fixed 10 coins per month (Jiang's approach)
4. **Train/test split**: Year-based boundaries (not percentage-based)
5. **Transaction costs**: Handle in RL environment (not data pipeline)
6. **Caching**: NPZ format for sharing via cloud storage

### What We'd Do Differently
- Read Jiang's implementation code earlier (saved time)
- Start with simpler test cases
- Write documentation sooner (clarifies thinking)
- Fix import paths from the start (use relative imports)
